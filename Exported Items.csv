Cui,iForest: Interpreting Random Forests via Visual Analytics,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,,1941-0506,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864475,,"As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests, which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users' mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.",2019-01,5/23/2023 9:34,5/23/2023 9:34,,407-416,,1,25,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cognition; Decision trees; Forestry; Impurities; Interpretable Machine Learning; Machine learning; Predictive models; Random Forest Visualization; Random Forests; Vegetation; Visual Analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various types of failures are being constantly registered during the execution of millions of computing operations daily. Monitoring systems are faced with a challenging task of the analysis of considerable amount of multi-sourced error messages. It is critical to present the information about errors to human experts in a way that makes them able to analyze it. ClusterLogs is a pipeline of methods that allows the discovering of common patterns in error messages and group similar messages for further analysis. This pipeline is able to cluster heterogeneous messages without any prior knowledge about textual pattern and can be executed in a fully automated way. In this work we describe a visual analytics web application that provides the analyst with the visual means of setting up clustering pipeline parameters and facilitates the interpretation and validation of the clustering results.",2021,9/11/2023 16:42,10/10/2023 9:10,,274-283,,,190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,clustering; log analysis; machine learning; natural language processing; pattern recognition; visual analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous monitoring tools have been developed that can alert stakeholders to the onset of cyanobacterial blooms to initiate mitigation efforts for waters used for recreation or drinking water supply. Early warning monitoring systems need to consider multiple aspects of a cyanobacterial bloom: whether a bloom is occurring in the source water, whether it might be transported to drinking water intakes, whether toxin or taste and odor compound producers are present and what proportion of the cells in a bloom they comprise, and whether cells are entering a utility at concentrations above threshold levels. No single monitoring tool can provide all this information, so multi-barrier approaches are needed. Reviews of monitoring tools and their variations are available, but they are generally limited to one type of tool. Instead, a review and comparison of all the available tools is needed to inform stakeholders of them and their relative advantages and limitations. Therefore, this review covers conventional tools including microscopic enumeration, pigment extraction, qPCR, probes, and remote sensing as well as emerging techniques including next-generation sequencing, photonic systems, biosensors, drones, and applications of machine learning and discusses them primarily from a practical and operational standpoint. Moreover, a three-tier framework is proposed for designing comprehensive early warning systems that groups monitoring tools by their analytical targets: biological activity or algal biomass, cyanobacteria or cyanobacteria-related genes, and cyanobacterial metabolites. First tier tools are generally simple and inexpensive to use, including turbidity, optical density, visual inspection, drones, chlorophyll a, and adenosine triphosphate. Changes in water quality conditions detected using a first tier tool triggers the use of a second tier tools for identification and quantification of cyanobacteria by microscopy, phycocyanin, biosensors, hyperspectral remote sensing, or next-generation sequencing. If potentially harmful concentrations of cyanobacteria are confirmed, third tier tools are deployed for quantifying concentrations of cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds or the genes that encode for them using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, mass spectrometry, qPCR, or other analytical methods. This framework is designed to minimize the time and cost associated with cyanobacteria monitoring without compromising the ability of stakeholders to detect the onset of a bloom.",2021,9/11/2023 16:45,9/11/2023 16:45,,108442,,,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Automated cell imaging; Drones; Monitoring; Phycocyanin; Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.",2016-01,10/10/2023 9:11,10/10/2023 9:11,,649–658,,1,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Browsers; Compass; Data visualization; Encoding; Grammar; Image color analysis; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clearing, excavation and rehabilitation activities related to bauxite mining have inﬂuenced land cover within this region since mining commenced in the 1960s. This paper presents a study that used machine learning and time series visualisation to analyse the land cover changes of the Darling Range using time-lapse multispectral images, with the aim of understanding the impact of the mining activities and land rehabilitation patterns of the region. Land cover changes were analysed using 14 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images between 1988 and 2014. The spatial distribution of land cover was classiﬁed automatically using machine learning algorithms, and their temporal changes were visualized for analysis. Supervised classiﬁcation was carried out based on the six spectral features of the images using three machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Naïve Bayes (NB). The results showed that the RF algorithm achieved overall accuracy, (ratio of correctly classiﬁed samples divided by the total number of samples), greater than 95% for all years. The temporal changes of land cover distribution over the study period were visualized using a change map. These changes were compared with land clearing and rehabilitation records of a mining company operating in that region. A close correlation was observed between the automated analysis outputs and the company’s records. This work demonstrates the potential use of machine analysis in improving the accuracy of spatial data related to land clearing; and in monitoring vegetation recovery of closed and rehabilitated mines.",2019-05,10/10/2023 9:11,10/10/2023 9:11,6/12/2023,23–32,,,108,,Ore Geology Reviews,"The spatial-temporal patterns of land cover changes due to mining activities in the Darling Range, Western Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To have an uninterrupted support from any of the industries, a regular structural health monitoring is very much essential. Again, the online monitoring is preferred over any of the conventional approach. In the recent past many researchers work on the failure analysis of online structural health monitoring. Though visual inspection can’t give better results in many aspects, so it is better to work on a method which can give better results with better accuracy and should be with less time consuming. In this present work we focus on inverse problems for the determination of crack parameters in the form of its location and severity. Basically, the present work is limited to, the failure analysis of a beam like structure. We have considered a cantilever beam for the analysis. The research work has been conducted in two phases. In the first phase the theoretical investigation of the structure has been performed through a numerical method called finite element analysis (FEA), which is comprised of different matrices such as mass matrix and the element stiffness matrix based on the material properties as well as loading conditions. The analysis has been performed with and without the presence of the crack parameters, which leads to give a result of different natural frequencies at different modes of free vibration. The results of natural frequency create a platform to identify unhealthy structures. In the second phase, the main objective of the findings in which the theoretical results have been trained to get the crack parameters as crack depth and crack location. Out of the several inverse techniques we choose the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the best method for this proposed work. ELM is a non-iterative single layer feed forward neural network (NN) system in which the weights and biases (parameters of the hubs) are set haphazardly and require not to be tuned amid the fair treatment. The weights (output) of the network are determined analytically through simple generalized Moore Penrose pseudo inverse operation. It is observed that the ELM gives a better result with better accuracy with less computation time. The robustness of the proposed work has been verified through a comparison study",2020,10/10/2023 9:11,10/10/2023 9:11,,2974–2982,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ELM; Failure Analysis and Quantification; FEA; Structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
